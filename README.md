# Unity Package Browser (LITE) and Extractor

This is the LITE version. The full version is forthcoming, it includes viewing assets directly within the app. You can view 3D models and interact with them, you can view any type of media asset, textures, etc, without extraction. I've posted a PREVIEW version of it on the release page along with some Demo unitypackages filled with assets. Be aware you WILL encounter errors as it is only a pre-release for preview purposes.

NOTE: There is no dependency on having Unity Editor installed. This is totally self-contained.

Extract the entire package or just checked items. You can use file streams (In-Memory extraction) or file based access which extracts to a Temp folder then deletes. Usings streams is alot faster, especially for large UnityPackage files.

## Why?

Because there isn't an existing reliable tool already. The closest you come is some Python script that's a bit outdated.

## What about Resource files and AssetBundles?

Not yet. I'm currently implementing uTinyRipper into the app, so probably in the next update.
