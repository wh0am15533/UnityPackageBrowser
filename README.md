# Unity Package Browser (LITE) and Extrator

This is the LITE version. The full version is forthcoming, it includes viewing assets directly within the app. You can view 3D models and interact with them, you can view any type of media asset, textures, etc, without extraction. I'm still production testing it so I didn't include it yet.

## Why?

Because there isn't an existing reliable tool already. The closest you come is some Python script that's a bit outdated.
